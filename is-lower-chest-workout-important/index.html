<h3 id="instead-every-chest-exercise-will-hit-every-part-of-it">Instead, Every Chest Exercise Will Hit Every Part Of It.</h3><p>Getting a strong lower chest is important not only to the esthetics of defined muscles, but to overall shoulder mobility and stability. Whether you’re swinging a tennis racket, throwing a baseball, or pushing a lawnmower or grocery cart, strong chest muscles are essential to a wide range of everyday activities and sports. This triangular muscle is located under the pec major in the upper chest area. The upper clavicular fibers (otherwise referred to as the “upper chest”) and the lower sternocostal fibers.</p>
<h3 id="and-make-sure-the-bar-doesnt-drag-against-your-body-throughout-the-movement">And Make Sure The Bar Doesn’t Drag Against Your Body Throughout The Movement.</h3><p>Chest exercises emphasizing the muscles’ lower fibers can improve your ability to punch, crawl, climb, swing a bat, tennis racquet, golf club, or perform any move in which you draw your upper arm toward and across your body’s midline. It enables us to apply a high amount of tension to our chest over time as we can: Even if you�re not comfortable doing decline exercises, you can still exercise your lower chest almost as much by working out on a flat bench. Another great isolation exercise for the chest!</p>
