<h3 id="to-solve-this-issue-weve-created-the-cash-me-outside-cardio-calisthenics-workout">To Solve This Issue, We’ve Created The “Cash Me Outside” Cardio Calisthenics Workout.</h3><p>Additionally, all of the training days are pretty intense so if you want to be able to get through the entire 30 days you will have to spend adequate time in recovery. While calisthenics might be better suited for doing supersets since there’s very minimal equipment to move between, supersets themselves aren’t unique to calisthenics. Some calisthenics workouts are done at such a fast pace that they also act as cardio. This is a sample 1 week workout that is similar to what is found in the day to day life of a marine.</p>
