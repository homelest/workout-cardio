You will have one main power lift for each of your 3 main workout days.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-do-it-three-times-if-you-want-to-but-twice-is-enough-when-combined-with-a-good-diet">You Can Do It Three Times If You Want To, But Twice Is Enough When Combined With A Good Diet.</h3><p>If you weigh more, then you would increase this number depending on your weight. This doesn�t mean you can�t use it, this workout is great for increasing your strength. Another great reason to use this. Some have separate days reserved for powerlifting exercises and bodybuilding workouts.</p>
