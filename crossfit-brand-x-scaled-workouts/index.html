The daily workouts, called wods (workout of the day), are posted on their website. But i also agree that any wod can be a beginner one with proper scaling so be sure to ask about scaling options. How you choose to work out during your pregnancy is up to you, but i cannot tell you how important it is to listen to your body. Every wod can be scaled, this is true.

Every crossfit wod (workout of the day) is expressed as an “rx” or “prescribed workout.” it gives jump heights, weights to be used, etc. For example, i used to do cf in my little apartment in north carolina.
