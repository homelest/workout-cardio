If u have enough energy to workout both chest and back on the same day, u can do it. Yes, you can train back and chest on the same day. I know chest and back are heavy workouts, so should i stick with this or just do chest one day and back another day.</p>
<h3 id="or-you-can-work-your-pushing-muscles--chest-shoulders-and-triceps--one-day-then-your-pulling-muscles--back-and-biceps--the-other-day">Or You Can Work Your Pushing Muscles — Chest, Shoulders And Triceps — One Day, Then Your Pulling Muscles — Back And Biceps — The Other Day.</h3><p>There are several ways to manage your muscle groups in your training schedule and missing it well with safety. Although i do change up my workout routines a few times a year, training chest and back on the same day is something i’ll stick to the majority of the time. Yes, chest and biceps can be trained together in a single workout safely and effectively. That’s because you’re literally getting a double pump.</p>
<h3 id="training-your-muscle-groups-on-a-single-can-also-make-your-workouts-more-effective">Training Your Muscle Groups On A Single Can Also Make Your Workouts More Effective.</h3><p>In fact, that’s exactly what the legend arnold schwarzenegger did when he was in his prime. However, you need to consider what your weaknesses are to figure out how you would structure the back and chest exercises. Working out chest and biceps on the same day may seem odd to some of you. For me, whenever i’m stuck in a training rut or in need of an absolutely killer pump, i always go back to arnold’s chest/back template.</p>
