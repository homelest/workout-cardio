&lt;p&gt;An upper body workout will normally hit your chest, back, shoulders, biceps and triceps, while the lower body workout works your quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes and calves. As the name suggests, an upper/lower split is a workout routine that splits training on the upper and lower parts of your body. This type of workout split offers a lot of flexibility in its scheduling which makes it ideal for a lot of people and whilst it typically sees you working out 4 times per week, it can be adjusted so you’re only doing. With an upper lower split, you train the muscles in your lower body and upper body on separate days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
