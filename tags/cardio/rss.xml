&lt;p&gt;Virtual team building exercises are online group activities that sharpen skills and strengthen coworker bonds. This tool helps to open discussion, to explore people’s feelings about the event, and to turn “passengers,” “protesters” and “prisoners” into valuable participants. This team building exercise puts leadership responsibilities back on your team, showing them that they have the potential to come up with solutions, too. Remote work bingo is an engaging team building game for remote teams that turns everyday virtual working experiences into something shared and fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
