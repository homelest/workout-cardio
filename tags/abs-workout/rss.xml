So, what we can say, is that in principle yes it is good to do yoga before or after a workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should i do yoga before or after a workout? We must stretch our sore muscles after a workout. One more thing you need to ensure is that you don’t push yourself. If the muscles are too relaxed before running, you might end up hurting yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
