But it won�t work in your favor either. While exercising and intermittent fasting may work for some people, others may not feel comfortable doing any form of exercise while fasting. Lift weights after your feeding window (9 or 9:30 pm in this example).</p>
<h3 id="if-you-find-that-the-sensations-of-lightness-in-your-stomach-feels-better-while-exercising-then-fasted-cardio-might-be-a-good-fit-for-you">If You Find That The Sensations Of “Lightness” In Your Stomach Feels Better While Exercising, Then Fasted Cardio Might Be A Good Fit For You.</h3><p>So if you’re looking for a temporary boost in your training programs, it may be helpful to consider. Stop working out if you feel weak, dizzy or short of breath. Generally speaking, drinking things like black coffee and (unsweetened) green tea while fasting are considered not to break a fast, even though they do contain a small number of calories. The protein you’ve ingested prior to your workout will support muscle repair after it.</p>
