We always suggest patients hold off on any form of working out for three to four days after their surgery is complete. Take the first few days following your lasik surgery very slowly, and get as much rest as possible. If you ride or run in a wooded area wearing eye protection is recommended.</p>
<h3 id="every-person-is-unique-however-so-make-sure-to-check-with-your-doctor-first">Every Person Is Unique, However, So Make Sure To Check With Your Doctor First!</h3><p>If you’re curious about lasik and interested in the Apply eye makeup (but please remove it gently and avoid touching the eyes). If you exercise in a gym, assume the equipment is covered in toxic bacteria. Typically this means the gym machines on low settings, although this can be increased to heavy, free weights after four weeks.</p>
<h3 id="during-the-first-week-our-doctors-will-also-ask-you-to-take-it-easy-with-exercise-activities">During The First Week, Our Doctors Will Also Ask You To Take It Easy With Exercise Activities.</h3><p>Lasik surgery is very accurate, and the recovery is really quick. Most doctors recommend waiting one week before resuming strenuous activity, but there are no set guidelines for returning to exercise and many people opt to work out again the day of their surgery or even on the same day. Begin slowly and increase the intensity over the next two weeks. It is best to avoid any activity that involves excessive sweating during the first few days following surgery.</p>
