Doing a full season capsule wardrobe is based on including a layering style and using a base amount of clothing that builds on itself as the seasons get colder. The necessities beyond the travel capsule wardrobe.</p>
<h3 id="im-56-and-usually-sm-or-6-in-clothes-and-85-to-9-in-shoes">I’m 5’6″ And Usually S/M Or 6 In Clothes And 8.5 To 9 In Shoes.</h3><p>This is why my workout wardrobe is a mix and match of my favorite staple pieces! My capsule wardrobe doesn�t include pj�s, workout clothes, loungewear, accessories (purses, bags, etc), or underwear but it does include shoes. Choose 10 items or less: Just a quick pop in today to show you what’s in my current 20 piece workout capsule.</p>
