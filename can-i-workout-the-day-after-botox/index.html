Exercising after botox will not reduce the results of injections of botox. There is no literature to support advising patients not to exercise for a specific duration after receiving botox injections. Straight away, this disqualifies many types of exercise activities, even low impact activities like yoga and stretching.</p>
<h3 id="to-be-honest-some-doctors-arent-sure-that-you-cant">To Be Honest, Some Doctors Aren’t Sure That You Can’t.</h3><p>Feel free to contact us with any questions or call us to book your next appointment. The more we exercise, the more we tense our face. This is actually pretty easy, just plan your botox session after you’d had your workout for the day and ideally the day before a rest day. Be sure you schedule your botox office treatments around your workout schedule.</p>
<h3 id="wait-24-hours-before-strenuous-exercise">Wait 24 Hours Before Strenuous Exercise.</h3><p>Walking unless you are a very brisk walker, you may replace your regular fitness regimen with a pleasant walk on the day of your botox procedure. Will botox wear off faster if i exercise frequently? After discussing this topic with several dermatologists, we noticed a theme in the answers they gave. You can engage in light exercise four hours after the botox procedure.</p>
