For a laparoscopic surgery, most people can go back to work or their normal routine in 1 to 2 weeks. I am a 25 yr old female and i had my gallbladder removed a week ago on 6/25/2010 by lap chole. Yes, check with your doctor next week and don�t do it before then.</p>
<h3 id="in-general-exercise-is-beneficial-for-gallstones-though-there-are-circumstances-when-you-should-avoid-exercise-1">In General, Exercise Is Beneficial For Gallstones, Though There Are Circumstances When You Should Avoid Exercise 1.</h3><p>This is due to the fact that gallbladder surgery requires general anaesthesia, which can increase your risk of complications when you are exercising. How soon can you do sit ups after gallbladder surgery? As far as my gallbladder removal, i was running 2 weeks after surgery, lifting 4. After the gallbladder has been removed, recovery time varies depending on how serious the illness was beforehand so healing may take up to several months before returning back to normal activities.</p>
