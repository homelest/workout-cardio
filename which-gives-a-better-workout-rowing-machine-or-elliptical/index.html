According to the harvard public health school, an elliptical machine burns slightly more calories than a rowing machine in an hour. It does help to note the varying health benefits of a rowing machine compared to an elliptical workout.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-are-targeting-the-lower-body-then-a-stationary-bike-is-the-winner-but-if-you-want-a-total-body-workout-then-elliptical-is-the-best">If You Are Targeting The Lower Body, Then A Stationary Bike Is The Winner, But If You Want A Total Body Workout, Then Elliptical Is The Best.</h3><p>When you are using elliptical equipment, you can move both forward and backward. Make sure you use this information to choose a machine that’s right for you and your fitness goals. Although the rowing machine offers more core training and a workout more specifically geared towards strength training, the versatility of being able to control which muscles get worked on an elliptical gives it the edge.
