Arrange your own small group workouts or pair up clients as workout buddies.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-motivation-try-new-and-different-exercise-options">Lack Of Motivation Try New And Different Exercise Options.</h3><p>Believe it or not, the simple act of being a good role model can have a big impact on the behavior of those around us. A simple “wow, your biceps look bigger” or “you look so sexy when you do squats” can go a long way. Select something they can do. Let her know that she rocked it.</p>
<h3 id="an-attentive-look-with-your-head-slightly-inclined-to-reveal-your-neck-shows-the-other-person-that-you-too-are-vulnerable">An Attentive Look With Your Head Slightly Inclined To Reveal Your Neck Shows The Other Person That You, Too, Are Vulnerable.</h3><p>Stationary bikes are great for cardio and they don�t take up a lot of space in your home. You haven’t gotten clear on your why. Be a good role model. If food tends to be a reliable motivator for your partner, agree on a plan to stop for a smoothie or healthy lunch on the way home, or pack a nutritious picnic in an insulated backpack to enjoy after your activity.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-love-to-exercise-its-natural-to-want-everyone-around-you-to-feel-the-good-vibes-but-influencing-other-people-to-change-is-challenging">When You Love To Exercise, It’s Natural To Want Everyone Around You To Feel The Good Vibes, But Influencing Other People To Change Is Challenging.</h3><p>Keep fitness equipment in the house, and encourage him to use it, too. Researchers found that exercisers are more motivated by working out with someone who is fitter than they are, while verbal encouragements—“you can do it!”—can actually be counterproductive. Get your workout clothes out the night before so you’re ready to go as soon as you get up. Keep a friend motivated by acknowledging the hard work she�s putting into her fitness regimen.</p>
