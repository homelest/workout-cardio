It is recommended that you wait at least 24 hours after wisdom teeth removal before exercising to allow full recovery. Wisdom tooth extractions are not subject to this restriction, even if they are simple.</p>
<h3 id="i-got-my-wisdom-teeth-out-i-think-3-or-4-years-ago-over-christmas-break-when-i-was-in-high-school-and-by-the-end-of-the-break-they-were-dissolved-i-believe">I Got My Wisdom Teeth Out I Think 3 Or 4 Years Ago Over Christmas Break When I Was In High School And By The End Of The Break They Were Dissolved I Believe.</h3><p>In most cases, you can resume normal activities after the first day, but it would be best to wait about a week. The patient should be allowed to fully recover. Yeah in that case i dont think i would go back to working out if i were you until the stitches dissolve. Apparently it depends from person to person.</p>
<h3 id="shouldnt-be-more-than-a-couple-weeks">Shouldnt Be More Than A Couple Weeks.</h3><p>Worst of all, the blood clot that grows in the extraction area after surgery may be dislodged, leading to dry socket. I had my wisdom teeth removed this summer, i would say you should wait a week, but i got back into it after like 4 or 5 days. The patient should be allowed to fully recover. How long after wisdom tooth extraction can i exercise?</p>
