There is almost nothing more influential to your health and performance than how you fuel your body on a daily basis. According to this paper, we should aim to consume at least 20g/hour of a glucose source, and up.</p>
<h3 id="while-consuming-some-whey-protein-immediately-post-workout-is-a-good-idea-theres-a-way-we-can-enhance-your-post-workout-nutrition-even">While Consuming Some Whey Protein Immediately Post Workout Is A Good Idea, There’s A Way We Can Enhance Your Post Workout Nutrition Even.</h3><p>If there’s one aspect of peri workout nutrition that hasn’t been downplayed over the years is the need to consume some form of nutrition immediately after your workout, i.e. Mechanical damage, volume of work, time under tension, and metabolic stress. This said, type 2as who are looking to add muscle mass can benefit from adding some proteins before the workouts. A rich eaa and carbohydrates drink sip along the workout will provide the necessary nutrients for growth while the fasted state before the workout will allow them to release epinephrine and glucagon.</p>
<h3 id="to-underestimate-pre-and-peri-that-means-during-btw-workout-nutrition-is-to-essentially-kiss-your-gains-goodbye">To Underestimate Pre And Peri (That Means “During”, Btw) Workout Nutrition Is To Essentially Kiss Your Gains Goodbye.</h3><p>By ingesting protein before and during a workout, you spare muscle protein, negate protein degradation, and set the muscle up for regeneration and remodeling. There’s hundreds of different opinions out there when it comes to what you should and shouldn’t eat before, during and after a workout… the majority of which are bs. For training sessions exceeding 2 hours in duration, an intra workout snack should be considered to maintain blood glucose levels. Peri workout nutrition has been one of the hotly debated topics in the fitness industry during recent years.</p>
<h3 id="branched-chain-amino-acids-and-other-essential-amino-acids-23">Branched Chain Amino Acids (And Other Essential Amino Acids) 2.3.</h3><p>The key process in this is to provide constant energy to the body never leaving it in a fasted state. You need to have a sufficient supply of energy (in the form of glucose) and a steady stream of amino acids (from protein) flowing through your body constantly if your intentions are muscle growth. After rather extensive amount of reading and experimenting with this subject i have realized how incredibly important this is to my training and recovery. Getting this protocol right for me has drastically changed my body composition.</p>
