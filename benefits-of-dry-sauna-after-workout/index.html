Most people prefer a wet, or steam sauna. Damage and injury are more likely to happen to muscles that are too relaxed and loose prior to intensive activity. Keep your sauna sessions short, no longer than about 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
<h3 id="in-addition-sitting-in-the-sauna-after-a-workout-can-help-eliminate-dead-skin-cells-and-expose-new-layers-of-skin">In Addition, Sitting In The Sauna After A Workout Can Help Eliminate Dead Skin Cells And Expose New Layers Of Skin.</h3><p>You shouldn’t expect your belly fat to be completely gone just from using the sauna but it will definitely help at least a little bit to get rid of it. This creates tiny tears in the muscles that cause soreness, inflammation, and tightness, among other symptoms. Using a sauna regularly will help you have younger looking skin in no time. If you are new to using the sauna, try shorter intervals in the 10 to 15 minute range.</p>
