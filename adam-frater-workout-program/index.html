<h3 id="his-workout-programs-focus-on-authentic-strength-and-functional-fitness-in-order-to-build-athletes-that-look-good-feel-good-and-perform-even-better">His Workout Programs Focus On Authentic Strength And Functional Fitness In Order To Build Athletes That Look Good, Feel Good, And Perform Even Better.</h3><p>Adam frater has been performing the calisthenics for over six years. Like for example it would be a chest day (something which doesn’t make sense for a calisthenics program which makes you do compound movement exercises) and he’d make you do exercises that work the shoulder. The program can transform any type of physique as long as the individual is performing it the right way. He believes that this is the perfect program for people craving a functional body that is mobile enough to be moved in any direction without muscle strains.</p>
