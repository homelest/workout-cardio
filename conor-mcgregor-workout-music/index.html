Conor mcgregor flaunts bulky new physique in workout video after �transformation�. Much of mcgregor’s time since enduring defeat in his trilogy bout with poirier has been taken up with bitter twitter taunts of his ufc rivals, but the irishman appears. Notorious looks as jacked as he has ever been as he continues along the road to a ufc comeback after breaking his leg in his last bout.</p>
<h3 id="the-third-song-is-hypnotize-by-biggie">The Third Song Is “Hypnotize” By Biggie.</h3><p>But non the less, this shows, conor mcgregor is somehow ahead of the curve when it comes to his training philosophy, and i don’t know how he figured this out, but by keeping his workouts fresh, by what i believe using reconsolidation, he appears to have gained a learning advantage when it comes to developing his fighting skills. As you can deduce, the conor mcgregor fitness regimen is as varied as it is intense. It covers a lot of ground so we’ll stop mincing words and cut right to the chase. Subscribe &amp; stay tuned !</p>
<h3 id="he-fought-in-the-biggest-fight-in-combat-sports">He Fought In The Biggest Fight In Combat Sports.</h3><p>On thursday, february 3, mcgregor was seen shirtless in his bed as he relished a pink and white frost lolly. He was spotted on the amalfi coast, getting in a beach workout. This song is a perfect match with mcgregor’s relaxed yet aggressive fighting style. Here, the music producer played a live soundtrack to mcgregor’s workout.</p>
