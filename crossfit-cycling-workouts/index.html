<h3 id="age-can-become-a-factor-if-you-want-to-do-crossfit">Age Can Become A Factor If You Want To Do Crossfit.</h3><p>There are literally thousands of different crossfit workouts. The workouts are scalable and varied so you can progress as your fitness level improves. I learned from a friend that he improved his cycling performance after going to a box 3 or 4 times a week. Some are ‘crossfit official’, and are subsequently used sporadically within crossfit gyms around the globe, while others may be designed by and used within a single gym.</p>
