As well as sweat, the friction between your skin and your sports gear may lead to irritation which is why working out during the immediate aftermath is off the cards. If you consider yourself a gym rat, try and get a great workout in before your tan. Any uv ray exposure should be avoided.</p>
<h3 id="you-should-be-able-to-resume-your-regular-activities-unless-you-are-getting-lhr-done-on-areas-that-are-exposed-to-sunlight-like-your-face-and-you-decide-to-go-working-out-in-the-heavy-sun-right-after-your-treatment">You Should Be Able To Resume Your Regular Activities, Unless You Are Getting Lhr Done On Areas That Are Exposed To Sunlight (Like Your Face) And You Decide To Go Working Out In The Heavy Sun Right After Your Treatment.</h3><p>Four to five days after your laser hair removal treatment, you can resume your normal shaving routine. You are not allowed to workout or exercise after laser hair removal for best results. Didnt you know not to work up sweat after wax/laser hair removal? Since laser hair removal is a cosmetic procedure, it’s important to conduct a consultation to make sure you know what to expect and so we can make sure there’s nothing stopping you from having the treatment.</p>
