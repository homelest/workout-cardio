<h3 id="speed-workouts-are-my-favorite-because-the-intervals-break-up-the-time-on-the-treadmill">Speed Workouts Are My Favorite Because The Intervals Break Up The Time On The Treadmill.</h3><p>Incline/hill sprints will give the lower extremities in particular (legs, hips, hamstrings, calves, shins) a very good strength workout, not to mention the abdominals and torso.
