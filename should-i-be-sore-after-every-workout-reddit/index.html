If your soreness has not improved five days later, you may have a more serious injury. For my old workouts, i was accustomed to at least some soreness the next day. You can sometimes get sore muscles immediately after or during a workout.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-only-work-out-a-muscle-group-once-a-week-you-might-be-sore-after-every-workout-but-if-you-work-out-that-same-muscle-group-twice-a-week-chances-are-you-will-have-minimal-soreness-after-2">If You Only Work Out A Muscle Group Once A Week You Might Be Sore After Every Workout, But If You Work Out That Same Muscle Group Twice A Week Chances Are You Will Have Minimal Soreness After 2.</h3><p>Like any damage to your soft tissues, this is likely to cause soreness. If you are sore from a workout, take a break from intense exercise, but consider active recovery like walking to help aid in recovery. “if you are experiencing soreness after every workout, chances are you are going too far, too fast,” says tyler. Most people experience more soreness when dieting, but that doesn�t mean they�re gaining more muscle.</p>
