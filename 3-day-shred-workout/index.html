<h3 id="today-was-day-30-of-my-experiment-with-jillian-michaels039-30-day-shred">Today Was Day 30 Of My Experiment With Jillian Michaels� 30 Day Shred.</h3><p>While each routine has stated workout days ofmonday, wednesday and friday, any other three nonconsecutive days each week can be used. In week 1, repeat each circuit three times before moving on to the next circuit. At this stage, you have everything you need. It’s much more convenient to fit 3 workouts into your weekly schedule than it is to fit 4, 5, or 6.</p>
<h3 id="1200-total-from-three-workouts-per-week--2300-after-300-calories-cut-daily--3500-estimated-calories-in-one-pound-of-fat">1,200 Total From Three Workouts Per Week + 2,300 After 300+ Calories Cut Daily = 3,500 Estimated Calories In One Pound Of Fat.</h3><p>Another key feature of this variation on the 3 day split workout is its full body workout plan training aspect where you can comfortably train multiple body parts one day and then rest for the next day, moving on with a different set. This 3 day shredding program is perfect for anyone looking to get ripped but can only make it to the gym 3 days out of the week. You can just as easily train on tuesdays, thursdays, and saturdays if it would be better for you. (sub in a dumbbell if necessary.) perform 12 to 15 reps of each exercise.</p>
