<h3 id="drink-about-15-to-30-minutes-before-your-workout">Drink About 15 To 30 Minutes Before Your Workout.</h3><p>Reviewed in the united states on november 4, 2014. Right now, vintage blast is available in a blueberry lemonade flavor. 5.0 out of 5 starsgreat deal.

<h3 id="it-gets-me-the-kind-of-pump-you-feel-after-getting-alot-of-weight-my-whole-body-feels-energized">It Gets Me The Kind Of Pump You Feel After Getting Alot Of Weight, My Whole Body Feels Energized.</h3><p>5.0 out of 5 starsdefinitely noticed a difference in the fact that i do not get tired as easily and have more energy to push myself harder. I bought it because i wanted a cheap pump product that wasn�t too much caffeine but had decent other ingredients as well. This is an attractive taste, but it does have a bit of a sour edge to it that is not for everyone. The fact that it contains no added sweeteners and is suitable for vegetarians makes it all the more appealing.</p>
