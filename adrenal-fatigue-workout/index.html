Workouts like crossfit or high intensity interval training (hiit), actually cause the most adrenal stress. Keep in mind that rest days are essential and pushing yourself will only hinder progress. These forms of exercise are great for staying active and promoting a healthy body, even for someone with adrenal fatigue.</p>
