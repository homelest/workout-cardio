An effective workout formula i sometimes use is to start with a fun partner drill then finish with 2 circuit training workouts. However, like i said, you may need to substitute these with a variation that is better suited for your individual body type, training experience, and needs. Switching up the scenery every so often can make workouts more interesting and fun, even if youï¿½re not changing up any of the actual exercises. See more ideas about workout humor, humor, gym humor.
