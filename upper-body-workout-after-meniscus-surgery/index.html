<h3 id="a-physical-therapist-will-be-assigned-to-you-and-begin-a-routine-of-light-exercise-to-help-stabilize-the-knee">A Physical Therapist Will Be Assigned To You And Begin A Routine Of Light Exercise To Help Stabilize The Knee.</h3><p>Is this merely a recommendation or is it essential to avoid placing any unwanted strain on the knee?
