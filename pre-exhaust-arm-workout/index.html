Well, there you have a good breakdown of the isolation movements and the compound movements for the major body parts. Using an isolation exercise at the beginning ensures complete and utter focus is given to a specific muscle group and then translating this into a compound exercise. For instance, you would complete two or three sets of 12 to 15 reps of dumbbell concentration curls and then begin performing standing barbell curls.</p>
<h3 id="you-need-a-solid-training-routine-in-support-as-well-as-good-nutrition-if-you-want-to-see-real-results">You Need A Solid Training Routine In Support, As Well As Good Nutrition, If You Want To See Real Results.</h3><p>So, sticking with the chest example, you would perform a set of flys, rest for one minute, perform a set of dumbbell presses, rest for. You may be surprised by how few you can do initially. The bench press is a compound exercise that targets the chest but the front delts and triceps are also heavily involved in the movement. In workout 2, make sure your hands on inside shoulder width on cable curls to emphasize the long head.</p>

The order that these two exercises are positioned will. Basically, it involves a compound exercise followed by an isolation exercise.</p>
