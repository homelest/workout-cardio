I still occasionally watch his routine where he comes out to googoo dolls. Hell, at one point, i think i’d collected articles/training routines on virtually every bodypart by mike matarazzo (one of my big favorites back in the day). He is currently recovering at his home with his family in modesto, california.</p>
<h3 id="olympia-2009-olympia-expo-2009-olympia-expo">Olympia 2009 Olympia Expo 2009 Olympia Expo:</h3><p>I met mike at the denver airport in probably 99. After training hamstrings, matarazzo had plenty of blood in the back of his legs, so he would capitalize on that pump by going directly into his calf workout. He was the first ifbb pro i ever saw irl i had only seen them in magazines before that. I’ll admit that i would get confused sometimes, though.</p>
