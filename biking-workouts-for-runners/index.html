Cycling allows you to build strength in your legs, hold a high heart rate for a long period of time, and minimize forceful impact on your legs. Conversely, biking utilizes mainly your lower body and does not build as much arm or core strength. Biking offers a variety of different health benefits, such as lowering your risk of cancer, improving the health of your heart and enhancing your level of fitness for other sports.</p>
