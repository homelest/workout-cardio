<p>During sustained strenuous exercise, you�re demanding extra effort from your muscle fibers, which means a greater number of them become exhausted and call it quits, gaesser says. Contrary to popular belief, our muscles don’t tremble during these exercises because we haven’t used them, but because we are isolating them more than we do in other forms of exercise, and therefore they become fatigued more quickly. By the end of your workout, the shaking you feel may be a sign of hypoglycemia, also known as low blood sugar. Enhance Your Results With A PreWorkout Routine.</p>
