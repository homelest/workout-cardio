<p>So you should have no problem finding and joining an anytime fitness, a health club that’s remarkably similar to 24 hour fitness in its offerings. I would much rather save $30 a month to use a smith machine. However, you can usually find a squat rack and lifting platform at anytime fitness as well as dumbbells heavier than 50lbs. Anytime has great weightlifting equipment and group fitness classes to choose from, where planet fitness is far more limited in these areas.</p>

So you should have no problem finding and joining an anytime fitness, a health club that’s remarkably similar to 24 hour fitness in its offerings. (going to shorten the gyms names from here out. Pf=planet fitness and af=anytime fitness) a friend and i signed up for af in january and it is a really nice place to work out.</p>
<h3 id="i-believe-youre-mistaken-about-the-ten-times-home-gym-five-dollars-planet-fitness-thing">I Believe You’re Mistaken About The “Ten Times, Home Gym, Five Dollars” Planet Fitness Thing.</h3><p>Now let’s take a closer look! That’s more than even the ubiquitous planet fitness! Do you want the convenience and low price point of planet fitness, or the size and breadth of features of la fitness? Planet fitness currently has 830 locations in the us.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-are-looking-for-something-better-than-the-basic-gyms-like-planet-fitness-but-at-a-similar-membership-cost-then-you-can-consider-joining-workout-anytime">If You Are Looking For Something Better Than The Basic Gyms Like Planet Fitness But At A Similar Membership Cost Then You Can Consider Joining Workout Anytime.</h3><p>I would much rather save $30 a month to use a smith machine. Even the premium membership that they call pf black card at planet fitness is cheaper than the basic membership at any other club. The basic difference between planet fitness and 24 hour fitness is that you’ll pay more and get more at 24 hour. It would cost you $22.99 per month and gives you access to all the pf clubs worldwide and has much more perks to offer.</p>
