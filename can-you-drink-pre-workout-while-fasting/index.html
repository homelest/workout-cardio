A Guide to Intermittent Fasting and Keto Fasting From superherojacked.com
Most people find that coffee in the morning before working out gives them a welcomed boost of energy that helps them push through a workout. These artificial ingredients can lead to a disturbance in your gut microbiome. Generally speaking, drinking things like black coffee and (unsweetened) green tea while fasting are considered not to break a fast, even though they do contain a small number of calories. If your workout for the day involves heavy lifting, you can do so in a fasted state, but you should prioritize eating a meal directly following your workout.
