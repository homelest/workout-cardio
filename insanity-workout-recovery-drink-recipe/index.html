<h3 id="as-an-alternative-i-had-found-that-chocolate-milk-was-a-good-substitute-for-shaun-t039s-special">As An Alternative I Had Found That Chocolate Milk Was A Good Substitute For Shaun T�s Special.</h3><p>The protein drink should come 30 minutes after the recovery drink, which should be about 30g of sugar (dextrose, ideally, but anything other than fructose is good) and about 10g of protein.
