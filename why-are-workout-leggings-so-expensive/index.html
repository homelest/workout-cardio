They’re not using the cheapest labor on earth, and so therefore the prices are higher, but you are — according to them — getting a more pristine, quality product. Not only does the craze show a woman’s basic fashion, but they are comfy to wear.</p>
<h3 id="a-new-study-just-might-convince-you-that-your-new-wares-really-are-worth-itfrom-a-psychological-standpoint-at-least">A New Study Just Might Convince You That Your New Wares Really Are Worth It—From A Psychological Standpoint, At Least.</h3><p>Men can tell leggings are easy to sport, which tells them you like being comfy and they are down with that. Business insider reports that it’s all about the way that retailers like lululemon market their apparel. Lululemon has amazing customer service so whenever customers have a problem they write a review about it and sometimes are very thorough on why the leggings are not a fit for them. In order to compare that against the markup i just mentioned, we need to do a little fancy math.</p>
<h3 id="why-does-lululemon-cost-so-much">Why Does Lululemon Cost So Much?</h3><p>Aotd dropped half the price. Does dri fit keep you warm? I’ve got 5 pairs of gymshark leggings, the classic ones as well as some cropped ‘dreamy leggings’ and pink ones in different fabrics. When lululemon lists items under “we made too much” it is almost always because the sizing is off, the color is unpopular or the material doesn’t hold up well.</p>
