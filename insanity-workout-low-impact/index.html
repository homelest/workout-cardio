What is Insanity Max 30? From lisamdecker.com
Will keep the insanity workout low key today and do a low impact version if necessary to give it a bit of a rest but do have a pilates and body balance class lined up. It is hard work but rewarding if you stick with it. Yes, you can do insanity without any impact. Insanity workout is a great way to correct your posture, if you are doing all the exercises correctly then use the core to get to a low level instead of making use of your back to bend.
