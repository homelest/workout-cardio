The question is, how many calories does jillian michaels’ yoga melt down burn exactly. Additionally, on the days i do workout i’ll be able to factor in that additional burn and ramp up my amr even more. This equals about 2.5 pounds (1.1 kg) lost per month from exercise alone ( 6 ). Now i’d know that if i eat around 1700 calories a day on the days i don’t work out, i won’t gain weight.
