Drinks such as coffee and tea, guarana extract, and green tea extract are rich sources of caffeine. I usually add some greens because they’re a good plant based protein source and also are rich in vitamins and minerals that our bodies need. Mix 1 scoop (53g) with 300ml of water. A snack should be consumed 30 minutes before an athlete begins training.
