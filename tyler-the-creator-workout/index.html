Another thing to note down is that tyler is a tall skinny guy and normally people that are tall and skinny will have the shoulder’s tyler has but it could also just come from the pushups. It has high energy and is not very danceable with a time signature of 4 beats per bar. His height is 1.88m tall, and his weight is 79 kg. Read an interview that he said he doesnt workout at all and eats sht, he actually said it was bc of his black genetics
