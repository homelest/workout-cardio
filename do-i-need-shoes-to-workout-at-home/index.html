<h3 id="running-shoes-and-targeted-training-shoes-help-you-run-faster-leap-farther-and-move-more-quickly">Running Shoes And Targeted Training Shoes Help You Run Faster, Leap Farther, And Move More Quickly.</h3><p>Whether or not you need to wear shoes while exercising depends entirely on the workout. Wear shoes that are expressly made for your exercise program and replace them when they show signs of too much wear and tear (about every three hundred miles of workouts). When working out in the comfort of your own home, you might assume that wearing shoes — like wearing a shirt or pants when no one is around — is optional. Of course, you don’t need to wear shoes for exercises that don’t typically require them like low impact yoga, pilates, floor abdominal workouts, and martial arts.</p>
