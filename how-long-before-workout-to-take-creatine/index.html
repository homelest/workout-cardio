Most athletes use creatine either less than one hour before or immediately after working out. You can take it shortly before you exercise, shortly after you exercise or at some time that isn’t close to when you exercise. You can consume creatine at any time during the day, but studies show that the best time to take it is right after a workout, along with your protein shake to support recovery and muscle mass.</p>
