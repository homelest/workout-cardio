<h3 id="pause-briefly-and-slowly-bringing-your-hands-to-the-starting-position">Pause Briefly And Slowly, Bringing Your Hands To The Starting Position.</h3><p>Tension toner is a revolutionary patented workout bar designed to keep tension on your muscles during the entire range of motion! Your elbows will bend slightly as you do this exercise. When starting every exercise covered here, you want a little tension at the start of the movement. It all started when i was about 10 years old when my grandpa shared with me how isometric exercises were an amazing type of workout.</p>
