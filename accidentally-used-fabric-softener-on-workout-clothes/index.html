<h3 id="they-rely-on-outdated-formulas-that-coat-your-fabrics">They Rely On Outdated Formulas That Coat Your Fabrics.</h3><p>These chemicals will block up the pores in the synthetic materials, reducing their ability to wick away moisture. Most workout clothes are designed to wick moisture away from your body, dry quickly and keep you cool as you are exercising. You won’t destroy the machine or your clothes, so relax. If you accidentally use fabric softener or starch when laundering your fr clothing, run them through the wash again to remove the flammable components.</p>
<h3 id="for-one-thing-most-of-todays-clothing-is-already-soft-to-the-touch">For One Thing, Most Of Today’s Clothing Is Already Soft To The Touch.</h3><p>I bought liquid fabric softener by.
