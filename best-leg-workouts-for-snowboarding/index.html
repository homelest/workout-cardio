Start in a high plank position with your shoulders directly above your hands. This helps you to prepare for the rotational aspects of being on. Using this simple squat you can do at home, you can focus on building up your quads on your left and right legs individually.</p>
<h3 id="start-high-and-go-lower-as-you-get-warmer">Start High And Go Lower As You Get Warmer.</h3><p>Great leg exercises for snowboarding are exercises like rear foot elevated split squats, dumbbell squat jumps and lateral split squats. Snowboarding even works out your arms and shoulders because they are used for balance as you ride. On their own, it’s a good idea to build up to at least five repetitions on each leg per workout. The next two exercises get you into your riding stance and challenge your quads, glutes and hamstrings.</p>
