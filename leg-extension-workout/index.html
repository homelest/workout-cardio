The leg extension exercise is essential when trying to build muscle in your quads. Leg extensions can be added to every leg workout. When it comes to burning calories and building muscle, no day is as important as leg day.</p>
<h3 id="this-will-be-your-starting-position">This Will Be Your Starting Position.</h3><p>The leg extension is an effective isolation exercise which builds muscle and strength in the quadriceps of the front leg. A leg extension machine is a workout that targets your quads and strengthens your lower body. Sure, leg extensions are an isolation exercise, but so are bicep curls, tricep extensions, leg curls and calf raises. But, the leg extension makes a great addition to any leg workout.</p>
