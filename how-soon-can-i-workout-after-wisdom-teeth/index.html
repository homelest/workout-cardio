Pulling a tooth out at home, From onettechnologiesindia.com
After going through more than a month of sheltering in place due to the virus, it should not be that difficult to take a few days off after your tooth extraction. I want to go back to the gym tomorrow because i am feeling good and my dentist said i can return to exercise 4 days after (this will now be 5 days). After five days you can go back to lifting heavier weights, but be wary of clenching your teeth. If you only had your upper wisdom teeth removed, you can return to exercise sooner than those who had lower wisdom teeth removed, since this is a less traumatic procedure.
