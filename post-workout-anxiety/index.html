Activities like these also help people who are feeling overly nervous and anxious about an upcoming test, a big presentation, or an important meeting. Some studies show that exercise can work quickly to elevate depressed mood in many people.</p>

Exercise a walk, a run, a good aerobics workout — it’s amazing how i can feel my shoulders and neck “unlock” in the middle of the workout. Add the stress you�re putting on yourself in the gym and your brain could be fried at the end of the day. Better yet, a new study suggests that doing your workout in one particular place could make you feel better—and it might even improve your feelings of anxiety and depression.</p>
