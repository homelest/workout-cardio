On your apple watch, open the workout app. This change stops siri from reading you your workout statistics and alerts while you are working out. This will end the workout and will present you a brief summary of your workout.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-browse-and-add-new-workout-types-to-the-workout-app">You Can Browse And Add New Workout Types To The Workout App.</h3><p>To remove the minutes from the exercise ring you have to go into settings &gt; health &gt; sources &gt; (iphone you recorded the workout on) &gt; exercise minutes. Go into your health app &gt; health data &gt; activity &gt; workouts &gt; data sources &amp; access &amp; just pick the device that matches up to incorrect exercise minutes &amp; swipe to delete them. From there, you should see every minute the iphone has recorded an exercise minute. We can remove workouts on activity app on apple watch and on iphone using iphone activity app.</p>
<h3 id="all-you-have-to-do-is-open-the-workout-app-on-apple-watch-swipe-left-on-whichever-workout-you-want-to-remove-from-the-list-and-tap-x">All You Have To Do Is Open The Workout App On Apple Watch, Swipe Left On Whichever Workout You Want To Remove From The List, And Tap X.</h3><p>I deleted the workout immediately but my watch awards say my record is 730 minutes or whatever. Swipe left on the workout you want to delete and tap “delete.” then, either select “delete workout &amp; data” or “delete workout only.” you most likely want “delete workout &amp; data.” the workout will be deleted, and the changes will sync back to your apple watch. However, if you want to remove the workout but keep the associated health data, which helps with activity ring progress and such, choose the delete workout only option instead. Choose other when you can�t find a matching workout type.</p>
