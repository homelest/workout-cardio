<p>Charlotte isn’t very outspoken on this dvd but in a way it’s quite charming as it’s like she’s a beginner too and is getting used to the moves. Whilst home comforts are lovely, i personally feel that the mix of potential peer judgment coupled with the different types of machines that the gym offers, means i put more effort into my workout when at the gym. I have never watched geordie shore and im not over familiar with who charlotte is but i figured that may be a good thing, all i know is her results seem amazing!
