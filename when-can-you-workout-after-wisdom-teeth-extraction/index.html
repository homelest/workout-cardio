<h3 id="the-patient-should-be-allowed-to-fully-recover">The Patient Should Be Allowed To Fully Recover.</h3><p>You may feel great but donât exercise or do too much activity for at least 24 hours. Strenuous exercises and works should be avoided, such as stretching, bending over, or heavy lifting; You can do light activities such as walking, cycling, and other similar activities that do not pressure the surgery site. So, looking after yourself and resting in the week following the procedure is a great way to speed up this process.</p>
