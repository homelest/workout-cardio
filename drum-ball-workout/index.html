Muted this song because i got copyrighted. The goal here is to drum along with the music and have fun, only using an exercise ball instead of an instrument. They sit in front of exercise balls which are propped up on hampers;</p>
<h3 id="you-can-use-a-yoga-ball-a-bucket-to-drum-on-and-whatever-fun-props-your-class-offers-you-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-drumming-workout">You Can Use A Yoga Ball, A Bucket To Drum On, And Whatever Fun Props Your Class Offers You To Get The Most Out Of Your Drumming Workout.</h3><p>Instead, participants use drumsticks to drum on an inflatable swiss ball (also called an exercise ball or yoga ball) that’s placed in a specially designed bucket, which stops the ball from moving whilst keeping the top ‘drumming’ surface roughly at waist height. Workout routines vary greatly, and so will the movements. You can always incorporate the moves you prefer too. Except it doesn’t actually involve any drums!</p>
