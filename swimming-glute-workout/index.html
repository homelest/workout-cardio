Along with strengthening your hips, legs, and glutes through kicking, swimming is also a great way to build significant upper body strength in the arms, back, chest, and major muscle groups. Anyone who has ever suffered from lower back pain knows that it is no joke. If you keep up the intensity, 30 minutes of swimming laps five days a week can achieve results that take longer on other cardio equipment as it works multiple muscle groups and gets the heart pumping quickly. A primary glute exercise would be monster walks.
