<h3 id="for-example-if-you-do-a-skill-practice-lift-weights-and-go-for-a-run-then-repeat-these-efforts-throughout-the-week-you-are-training-concurrently">For Example, If You Do A Skill Practice, Lift Weights And Go For A Run, Then Repeat These Efforts Throughout The Week, You Are Training Concurrently.</h3><p>Concurrent training refers to a training session or program that includes some form of “endurance” exercise and “resistance” exercise. Concurrent training is the inclusion of both resistance and endurance training within the same training program. Another variation on concurrent training is to mix aerobic training with resistance training, an approach aptly named integrated concurrent training because you’re integrating the two forms of training into a single workout. Concurrent training by definition means training for achieving multiple training goals at the same time.</p>
