6 Day Low Volume HighIntensity Workout Split Workout From pinterest.com
Just take a day off between each workout. When you do a full body routine you’re raising these rates of muscle protein synthesis for your entire body 3 times per week.

As long as equipment is not a limiting factor, these exercises should be the bread and butter of any effective full body workout program.
