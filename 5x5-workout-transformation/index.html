I did stronglifts 5x5 for about a year and a half.</p>
<h3 id="the-stronglifts-55-program-alternates-between-two-workouts-three-times-a-week-with-at-least-one-full-day-of-rest-between-workouts">The Stronglifts 5×5 Program Alternates Between Two Workouts, Three Times A Week With At Least One Full Day Of Rest Between Workouts.</h3><p>You can start this program doing 5x5, but you will need to switch to 3x5 soon enough as 5x5 is going to become too much. 1 frozen banana, strawberries, cashew butter, spinach (you can�t taste it), walnuts, chia seeds, coconut flakes, rice protein powder, almond milk. I was checking out this stronglifts 5x5 program and i was wondering if i should consider doing it 3 days a week (can it be done 5 days a week?) but it looks very limited. Stronglifts is not only great to get stronger but also gives crazy amounts of volume if followed in a good manner.</p>
