When you are taking in enough protein after workout, your muscle tissues come back stronger and denser. It has been shown that muscle protein synthetic rate (mps) is elevated in humans by 50% at 4 hrs following a bout of heavy resistance training, and by 109% at 24 hrs following training. When you consume protein, your body uses that to build and repair tissues, so it becomes not only important for muscle recovery but much more.</p>
<h3 id="but-science-says-it-all-depends-on-how-intense-your-workout-is-and-not-your-body-size">But Science Says It All Depends On How Intense Your Workout Is, And Not Your Body Size.</h3><p>The protein helps your body repair and adapt the muscles that were used during the exercise. This will depend on your size and your goals. In theory, ingesting protein right before or right after your workout makes amino acids (leucine in particular) available to your muscles when they need it most. Meaning you are metabolically active because of the increased muscle mass.</p>
<h3 id="most-traditional-sports-drinks-do-not-contain-protein-but-there-are-some-that-do-and-interestingly-many-that-do-have-added-protein-that-is-isolated-from-milk">Most Traditional Sports Drinks Do Not Contain Protein, But There Are Some That Do, And Interestingly Many That Do Have Added Protein That Is Isolated From Milk.</h3><p>Adding protein prior to your training session primes the pump: Protein intake is a vital part of any diet, but when working out its importance increases. Liquid forms of protein prevent muscle wasting, because they digest easily and deliver amino acids to your muscles quickly. A 250ml serving of milk and chocolate milk contain approximately 9g of protein.</p>
