With its intense cardio bursts and bodyweight focused exercises, hiit workouts can push your body to the limit, making the proper foods important to performance and recovery. I do two mins warmup, four cycles (one min high alternating with one min low) and two mins cooldown.</p>
<h3 id="for-those-who-utilize-the-hiit-workout-then-eating-the-right-food-before-and-after-the-workout-can-make-your-results-even-better">For Those Who Utilize The Hiit Workout, Then Eating The Right Food Before And After The Workout Can Make Your Results Even Better.</h3><p>Hiit workouts demand a lot from the body. Drink an 8 ounce glass of water before your workout; What workout should i do after a hiit workout? And it helps your body to overcome the hard workout that you gave it when eating right after the workout.</p>
