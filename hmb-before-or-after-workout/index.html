HMB Post Workout Supplement by Infinite Labs From infinitelabs.com
It is advised to consume hmb 1 hour before or after your workout session. Studies suggest that it is best to take hmb before exercise or high intensity training.

<h3 id="hmb-is-typically-taken-throughout-the-day-and-timed-around-workout-routines">Hmb Is Typically Taken Throughout The Day And Timed Around Workout Routines.</h3><p>Supplementing with hmb either immediately before or directly after a workout is the ideal time to take it. One study noted that taking it before exercise may have prevented lactic acid from accumulating in the body. It is advised to consume hmb 1 hour before or after your workout session. Protein consists of individual amino acids.</p>
