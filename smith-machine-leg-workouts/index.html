Even if a smith machine is the only piece of gym equipment available for your workout, you can still blest your legs. Grab the bar in the middle with your right hand and shrug your shoulder up as high as possible while keeping your arm as straight as you can. Stand erect inside a smith machine holding the bar in front of your upper thighs, with your chest up, shoulders back and eyes focused forward.</p>
