<h3 id="if-youre-fighting-the-battle-of-the-belly-bulge-the-treadmill-is-a-fantastic-fat-burning-machine-to-try">If You’re Fighting The Battle Of The Belly Bulge The Treadmill Is A Fantastic Fat Burning Machine To Try.</h3><p>You could have the strongest stomach muscles in the world, but if you have an average amount of body fat in this area, your tummy won’t look like a washboard. We love this workout because it doesn’t matter if you just have 10 minutes, 20 or 30 minutes. The treadmill has been shown to burn calories at the highest rate of any cardio exercise machine and running on a treadmill is one of the most effective ways to lose belly fat. It’s easy to use and can be adapted to any level of fitness.</p>
