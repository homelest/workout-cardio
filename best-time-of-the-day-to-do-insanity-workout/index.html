The general agreement among experts is try to fit exercise in the morning as it can give you a boost for the rest of the day. Working out in the morning can help you sleep better and may even lower your blood pressure. Men at risk for diabetes had greater blood sugar control and lost more belly fat when they exercised in.</p>
