Push/Pull/Legs Weight Training Workout Schedule For 7 Days From pinterest.co.uk
With the exception of legs (aside from legs day i try and run 3x / week), i�ve been considering a routine that hits each upper body muscle group twice per week, focusing mostly on compound lifts. In a 5 day split, you work on each muscle group of your body on a different day, so usually don’t even work out the same muscle group more than once or twice a week. Training 4 times a week, you hit each muscle 2 times per week. For example, your anterior delts will be worked on both chest and shoulder days, so they will be hit twice a week.

<p>Training 4 times a week, you hit each muscle 2 times per week. If you feel seriously fatigued, over several days, you can definitely scale back your training and take an extra rest day or two. This also enables you to perform different types of exercises such as big compound lifts and isolation exercises all at different set and rep ranges. Top 5 Day Workout Routine For Man Bodydulding.</p>
<h3 id="even-with-volume-being-equated-hitting-each-muscle-group-twice-per-week-simply-works-better-than-hitting-it-just-once-per-week--source-">Even With Volume Being Equated, Hitting Each Muscle Group Twice Per Week Simply Works Better Than Hitting It Just Once Per Week ( Source ).</h3><p>Hence, targetting every muscle group once a week is better. Training 4 times a week, you hit each muscle 2 times per week. Depending on the frequency, your session can be shorter. Using a bro split, you train 5 times a week (suboptimal in terms of efficiency) while training each muscle group only once a week (suboptimal in terms of effectiveness).</p>
<h3 id="i-still-want-to-be-able-to-hit-each-muscle-group-twice-a-week-so-what-do-you-think-about-this">I Still Want To Be Able To Hit Each Muscle Group Twice A Week, So What Do You Think About This:</h3><p>It�s a 3 day split that should be performed twice a week, with a day break between a and b workouts. Biologically, it only takes ~72 hours for a broken muscle to recover. While a 5 day bro split only targets each muscle group once a week, there will be some inevitable overlap in the muscles worked. The 5 day split workout is extremely manageable, you hit the gym 5 days a week and focus on an individual muscle group each workout.</p>
<h3 id="i-can039t-train-anymore-than-5-days-a-week-so-i039m-looking-for-a-program-that-hits-each-muscle-group-twice-maybe-something-like-chestback-shouldersarms-legs-chestback-shouldersarms">I Can�t Train Anymore Than 5 Days A Week, So I�m Looking For A Program That Hits Each Muscle Group Twice (Maybe Something Like Chest/Back, Shoulders/Arms, Legs, Chest/Back, Shoulders/Arms)</h3><p>In a 5 day split, you work on each muscle group of your body on a different day, so usually don’t even work out the same muscle group more than once or twice a week. With the exception of legs (aside from legs day i try and run 3x / week), i�ve been considering a routine that hits each upper body muscle group twice per week, focusing mostly on compound lifts. It involves 5 consecutive workouts in a row. Also, the 5 day split offers two rest days.</p>
<h3 id="so-you-can-divide-the-same-volume-across-more-sessions-per-week-instead-of-squeezing-in-a-lot-of-volume">So, You Can Divide The Same Volume Across More Sessions Per Week Instead Of Squeezing In A Lot Of Volume.</h3><p>Basically been following my own routine, typical 5 day split (chest, back, legs, shoulders, arms) but i feel i need to mix it up a bit. For added variety, you could use different set and rep schemes on different training days. By hitting each muscle group twice a week you have multiple options of workout programs including; For example, your anterior delts will be worked on both chest and shoulder days, so they will be hit twice a week.</p>
