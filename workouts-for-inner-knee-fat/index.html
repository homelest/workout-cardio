<h3 id="slowly-bend-at-the-knees-to-return-to-the-original-position">Slowly Bend At The Knees To Return To The Original Position.</h3><p>Toned knees come from strong quadriceps, hamstrings and calf muscles. You must remember that any changes in your diet or workout plan should first be discussed with your doctor. Walking slims down your entire legs. The knee is supported by several tendons and ligaments, and while there are no muscles directly on the joint, many cross the joint via tendons.</p>
