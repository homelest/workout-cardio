Why Your Shoulder Hurts Tradewinds Health &#43; Fitness From crossfittradewinds.com
It’s this quick onset soreness that you feel in the gym, between sets, or right after you finish your workout. I�ve had this feeling before, and it�s because you didn�t fully extend your arms when curling, next arms day make sure to fully extend your arms and you shouldn�t have this problem. Back started hurting right after the workout, got home, slept, woke up, stretched and couldn�t move at all. This can ultimately make it difficult for you to put your arms behind your back.
