<h3 id="pay-attention-to-your-body-only-you-can-decide-what-training-volume-and-frequency-works-best-for-you-or-how-much-recovery-time-you-need">Pay Attention To Your Body Only You Can Decide What Training Volume And Frequency Works Best For You, Or How Much Recovery Time You Need.</h3><p>My general rule of thumb when resting between workouts is 48 hours for small muscles such as biceps, triceps, calves. Other experts suggest resting up to 72 hours between workouts if you�re an exercise newbie, while some say eight hours of good sleep is enough for your body to recover. No real gains will be seen by working the chest three days in a row (and doing so may cause more harm than good). For better muscle gain the body needs a complete recovery, so 48 to 72 hours is best.</p>

As you can see, each muscle group gets trained just once per week with 6 days of rest in between each workout for the same muscle. Another approach would be to take a rest day after working the chest on two consecutive days.</p>
