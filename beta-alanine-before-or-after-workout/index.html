For people attempting metabolic type workout regiments, (resting frequently between sets), beta alanine can help the body to recover rapidly during the rest periods. It is best to take beta alanine 30 to 45 minutes before you begin exercising.</p>
<h3 id="this-allows-for-an-increased-calorie-burn-and-higher-intensity-throughout-the-workouts">This Allows For An Increased Calorie Burn And Higher Intensity Throughout The Workouts.</h3><p>This should continue for between an hour and a half and 2 hours after taking the supplement, depending on activity levels. After that, your workout should be finished. This ensures that the supplement will have time to enter your system and begin working. Take beta alanine before and after workouts.</p>
