<h3 id="6-weeks-of-the-work-has-unique-videos-for-42-days--which-include-two-rest-days-a-week--one-day-with-no-video-just-relaxation-on-your-own-and-one-day-with-a-short-stretching-and-mobility-video">“6 Weeks Of The Work” Has Unique Videos For 42 Days — Which Include Two Rest Days A Week — One Day With No Video (Just Relaxation On Your Own), And One Day With A Short Stretching And Mobility Video.</h3><p>Amoila cesar is the trainer for 6 weeks of the work and is one of many of the trainers that provide excellent workout from the beachbody fitness company. Running a half marathon is something that anybody can accomplish however few of us actually do run half marathons. I have not been able to find a calendar on the tbb website.
