I really like the taste of this pre workout but unfortunately i had a negative reaction which is common with the some of the ingredients within the product. Teens who take illegal anabolic steroids are at risk for the same issues as grownups who use them. Reacts to something by mistake, such as harmless food, plants, or medicine.</p>
