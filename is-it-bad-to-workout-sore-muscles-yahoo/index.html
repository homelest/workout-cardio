<h3 id="delayed-onset-muscle-soreness-or-doms-is-common-particularly-for-those-who-are-new-to-working-out-or-are-returning-to-the-gym-after-a-long-absence">Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness, Or Doms, Is Common, Particularly For Those Who Are New To Working Out Or Are Returning To The Gym After A Long Absence.</h3><p>It’s just a sign that the muscle has been taxed. The minor discomfort or soreness you feel in your muscles in the days after exercise is normal, especially if you�ve just increased the intensity of your workout or tried something new.

<h3 id="trying-a-new-type-of-exercise-or-increasing-the-intensity-can-increase-how-sore-you-are-in-the-days-following-a-workout">Trying A New Type Of Exercise Or Increasing The Intensity Can Increase How Sore You Are In The Days Following A Workout.</h3><p>What the soreness is bad coaches are also saying is that you shouldn�t be chasing soreness i.e. Seek medical attention immediately if you experience any of the following after a workout or activity that causes muscle soreness: Still sticking with your 2022 workout goals? If you’re starting a new workout program or taking steps to push your current one to the next level, it’s normal for your muscles to feel sore afterward—especially the following day.</p>
