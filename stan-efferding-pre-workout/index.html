Stan Efferding 500 lbs 1 Arm Deadlift (x2) &#43; 700 lbs From youtube.com
I was born and raised in portland, oregon and graduated from the university of oregon where i studied exercise science. The fruits listed below do not spike insulin, hence they are good choices pre workout: Stamina endurance i find that your workouts can last longer tend to recover better and so i would recommend salt but primarily for this reason because i know people immediately start to be concerned that salt is going to cause a heart attack or lead to high blood. This led to numerous world records, including the raw squat and the raw bench press.
